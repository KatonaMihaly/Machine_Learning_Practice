The Vinho Verde Wine Quality Dataset is a collection of physicochemical and sensory attributes of red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The dataset includes over 6,000 records, with each record representing a wine sample. The primary goal of the dataset is to predict the quality of the wine based on its physicochemical properties. The dataset is suitable for both classification and regression tasks, as well as for feature selection and outlier detection.

**Key Features**

**Physicochemical Properties:** Includes attributes such as acidity, sugar content, sulfur dioxide levels, density, pH, and alcohol content.

**Sensory Data:** The target variable, quality, is a score between 0 and 10.

**Two Variants:** Separate datasets for red and white wines.

**Large Dataset:** Over 6,000 records for robust analysis.
